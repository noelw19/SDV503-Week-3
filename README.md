# SDV503-Week-3
 Lab 2

 Journal

 In this class we ended up talking about operators and working out how to find the results of any equation by using console.log(), we also looked at pre-increments and post increments.

 pre-increments: evaluates the expression then returns x.

 post-increment: returns x and then proceeds to evaluate the expression.

 I was having trouble the other day with pre and post increments and today I learnt that both types do work and just present different values.

Use cases of increment/decrement operator

pre :

if we want to increment the value and use it right now.

post:

if we want to increment the values and use it later.

we also spent some time in the second class for the week going over loagical operators, OR ||, AND &&, as well as the NOT EQUAL TO !==.

OR being when either value is found to be true, AND being when both are true and NOT EQUAL TO will show a true when the values do not match.
